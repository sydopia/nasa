            One of the big questions was, "How to get back safely to Earth?" The LM navigation system wasn't designed to help in this situation. The damage to the SM made safe return from a lunar landing impossible, so Lead Flight Director Gene Kranz ordered an abort of the mission. Kranz chose the alternative circumlunar option, using the moon's gravity to return the ship to Earth.

            <p>Apollo 13 continued on the trajectory to the moon in order to pass around it and gain momentum from the moon's gravity to coast back to earth. </p></div>

            At 55 hours, 46 minutes, as the crew finished a 49-minute TV broadcast showing how comfortably they lived and worked in weightlessness, Lovell said, "This is the crew of Apollo 13 wishing everybody there a nice evening, and we're just about ready to close out our inspection of Aquarius and get back for a pleasant evening in Odyssey. Good night."

            <p>Nine minutes later, oxygen tank No. 2 blew up, causing the No. 1 tank to also fail. The command module's normal supply of electricity, light and water was lost, and they were about 200,000 miles from Earth. Swigert saw a warning light that accompanied the bang and said, "Houston, we've had a problem here."</p></div></div>

            <p>Apollo 13 was the seventh manned mission in the Apollo space program and the third intended to land on the Moon. The craft was launched on April 11, 1970 from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank exploded two days later, crippling the Service Module. Despite great hardship, the crew returned safely to Earth on April 17, 1970, six days after launch.</p><p>The flight passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of 254 kilometers above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km from Earth, a spaceflight record marking the farthest humans have ever traveled from Earth.</p></div></div>

            <p>Apollo 13 was to be the third lunar landing attempt, but the mission was aborted after rupture of service module oxygen tank. Still, it was classified as a "successful failure" because of the experience gained in rescuing the crew. The mission's spent upper stage successfully impacted the moon.</p><p>Apollo 13 was supposed to land in the Fra Mauro area. An explosion on board forced Apollo 13 to circle the moon without landing. The Fra Mauro site was reassigned to Apollo 14.</p></div></div>

            <h1>[ Warnings ]</h1>
            <p>Ground tests before launch indicated the possibility of a poorly insulated supercritical helium tank in the lunar module, or LM, descent stage, so the flight plan was modified to enter the LM three hours early in order to obtain an onboard readout of helium tank pressure.</p><p>During the first two days, the crew ran into a couple of minor surprises, but generally Apollo 13 was looking like the smoothest flight of the program. At 46 hours, 43 minutes Joe Kerwin, the capsule communicator, or Capcom, on duty, said, "The spacecraft is in real good shape as far as we are concerned. We're bored to tears down here." It was the last time anyone would mention boredom for a long time.

            The warning lights indicated the loss of two of three fuel cells, which were the spacecraft's prime source of electricity. With warning lights blinking, one oxygen tank appeared to be completely empty and there were indications that the oxygen in the second tank was rapidly depleting.
            </p>
            <p>Because the fuel cells generated the Command/Service Module's electrical power by combining hydrogen and oxygen into water, when oxygen tank 1 ran dry, the remaining fuel cell finally shut down. The crew was forced to shut down the CM completely to save this for re-entry, and to power up the LM to use as a lifeboat. This situation had been suggested during an earlier training simulation, but had not been considered a likely scenario. Without the LM, the accident would certainly have been fatal.</p></div></div>

           Four hours before landing, the crew shed the service module; mission control had insisted on retaining it until then because everyone feared what the cold of space might do to the un-sheltered CM heat shield. Photos of the service module showed one whole panel missing and wreckage hanging out, it was a mess as it drifted away. Three hours later, the crew left the lunar module Aquarius and then splashed down gently in the Pacific Ocean near Samoa.</p></div>
